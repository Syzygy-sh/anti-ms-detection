# anti-ms-detection
An script that took probably most of my time to make, where I tried to look all across different games like ERLC and stuff try to dump the decompiled with Konstant (pseudo-code) from each of their scripts, then I would try to find the Macsploit detections and think how I could hide it from the games. This took a while to make, and I am glad to finally finish it. I can now share it with the community and see your thoughts about it!
No more Macsploit detections (for the games that have it), and if I missed anything or something gets detected in a game, let me know and try to fix it (if possible).

*ps: some detections in some games were impossible to fix, so I left it alone. enjoy the current anti detections for now
